#this script should customize a shapefile map for the locations of where samples of S. lacustris were found

# load data and shapefiles

# another way to do it is to use a shapefile as a background
# this is a shape file with state boundaries
states<-st_read("/Users/abhimehrotra/Desktop/spongehunters/map_data_files/states")

# what you'll notice is this shapefile has a much larger spatial extents than we need. We can change that by cropping it
la.b<-st_crop(states,xmin=-94.15,xmax=-89,ymin=29,ymax=33.15)
# another way to do this is to subset down to just the Louisiana polygon
la.c<-states[states$STATE_NAME=="Louisiana",]

# now I'm going to bring in some example sites- you'll replace this with the correct function and file path to bring in your sites
sites<-read_xlsx("/Users/abhimehrotra/Desktop/spongehunters/map_data_files/Miller_sponge gps coordinates_summer 2021.xlsx", sheet="Sl")

# now to make a pretty map
theme_set(theme_bw())

# First I'm going to make a base map that we can work through adding things to, that way you can pick and chose and make the map your own.
# if you want to use one of the shapefile base maps use this code to make your base map
(map1<-ggplot()+
    geom_sf(data=la.c))# I'm going to start with the cut out of Louisiana I made by subsetting the states shapefile 

# this assigns the answer to x but doesn't show you what it is in your console. This next line does both:
(x<-793*8)

# now to add sites to each map
# Now that we're done exploring how to change the shape and color of points I will add these to my base map so we can explore other
# changes we can make
(map1<-map1+
    geom_sf(data=la.c)+
    geom_point(aes(x=Long,y=Lat, color=Sl),data=sites,size=3))

# Now I'm going to show you different ways to change the colors of the points.
# if you have just a few points (or categories of points) you can manually assign colors:

# other good ones are:
if(!require(RColorBrewer))install.packages("RColorBrewer");library(RColorBrewer)
# color brewer has a lot of palettes you can see them here: 
display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE) # you can turn off the color blind friendly filter, but that limits the accessibility of your map

# note you can change the title of the legend here too:
(map1<-map1+
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2",name="Spongilla lacustris"))

# now lets look at changing the axis labels. There are a couple ways that you can do this (a good resource: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
# I am going to show you the easiest way if you aren't changing other things about the axes (which you don't typically have to do with a map)
(map1<-map1+
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
          axis.title.y=element_blank()))

# other things you might want to do

# add title, change size, and make it italic
(map1<-map1+
    ggtitle("Spongilla lacustris")+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8,size=20,family="sans",face="italic",color="orange")))

# get rid of the grid lines in the background:
(map1<-map1+
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank()))

# This removes all legends
(map1<-map1+
    theme(legend.position="none"))

# you can also make something bold or italic
(map1<-map1+
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size=12,family="sans"),
          axis.title= element_text(size=15,family="sans")))
